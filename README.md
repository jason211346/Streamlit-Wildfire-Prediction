# Streamlit-Wildfire-Prediction


We are using the Forest Fires Dataset from the [ UCI Machine Learning Repository Forest Fires Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/162/forest+fires). The original dataset provides multiple features to predict whether a fire will occur in a given area. We applied preprocessing techniques to clean the dataset so that we can treat it as a classification problem.

We compare serveral different ML alogthrims,More information about the Machine Learning model can be found at [Forest-Fire-Area-Classification](https://github.com/e96031413/Forest-Fire-Area-Classification)
